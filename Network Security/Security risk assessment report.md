## Scenario 

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1.	The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

## Respond
### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

1. Firewall maintenance entails checking and updating security configurations regularly to stay ahead of potential threats.
2. Multifactor authentication (MFA)	A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. MFA options include a password, pin number, badge, one-time password (OTP) sent to a cell phone, fingerprint, and more.
3. Password policies The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) latest recommendations for password policies focuses on using methods to salt and hash passwords, rather than requiring overly complex passwords or enforcing frequent changes to passwords.

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations

1. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network. After update of firewall rules organization can detect suspicious incoming and outgoing traffic. This should be monitored on regular basis.
2. MFA requires users to use more ways to identify and verify their credentials before accessing an application. This will protect the organization from various attacks e.g. brute-force or dictionary attacks.
3. It requires the employees to include rules regarding the strength of the passwords, the combination of text, numbers, and symbols and discourage password sharing. Additionally, the organization can set up a prompt that the user will lose access to the network after three unsuccessful attempts.
