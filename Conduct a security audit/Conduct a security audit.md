# Controls and Compliance Assessment
## Case Study
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist. 

## Scope and goals of the audit

### Scope

The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys.
This includes their assets like employee equipment and devices, their internal network,
and their systems. You will need to review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls
and compliance practices they have in place.

### Goals 

Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to
determine which controls and compliance best practices that need to be implemented
to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

## Current assets

Assets managed by the IT Department include:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones),
remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations,
surveillance cameras, etc.
- Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the
company’s adjoining warehouse
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
- Internet access
- Internal network
- Data retention and storage
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring

## Risk assessment

### Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

### Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

### Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

### Additional Info 

In Cybersecurity, control types can be classified in three ways: 
1. Administrative/Managerial controls
2. Technical controls
3. Physical/Operational controls

Control types (providing defense and protecting assets) include, but are not limited to:
1. Preventative (preventing an incident from occurring in the first place)
2. Corrective (restoring an asset after an incident)
3. Detective (Determining whether an incident has occurred or is in progress)
4. Deterrent (Discouraging attacks)

**Recommendations (optional):** 

After researching Botium Toys's security posture, the analysts agreed that the security practice is far from the expectation. It lacks of protection of confidentialiy of sensitive information. The following are:
- Least privilege
- Password policies
- Encryption
- Password management system
To address gaps in compliance, Botium needs to implement and establish the policies that can address the following above. Botium also needs to update its assets so the additional control can be identified as soon as possible to improve their security practice.
